      <description>What is Data Leakge?
Data leakage refers to a problem where information about the holdout datasets, such as test or validation datasets, is made available to the model in the training dataset. This leakage is often small but can have an adverse effect on the model&amp;rsquo;s performance
To simplify this, we can also say that when the information of test data is passed into the train data and our model knows about the test data while training.</description>
